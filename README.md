## What's For Dinner?
This app will help you answer the question of dinner quickly and randomly.

#### Deploy Link
Try the website here!

### Description
This app was put together over the course of five days as an assignment from Turing School of Software and Design. It was the first time myself and most of the students touched CSS, and it was a fun learning experience.

The spec for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/dinner.html).

Ultimately, users can select the saved **side**, **main**, and **dessert** options to randomly generate a specific meal component, or use our **entire meal** option to put a complete random meal together!

### Getting Started
#### Set Up
To view the app in your browser, simply click the deploy link and get started! If you'd like to edit the app on your own machine, complete the following steps:
  - Fork this project so that you have your own version.
  - Clone the repository onto your local computer.
  - Move into the project and make any changes you'd like!
#### Execution
If you choose to use this version of the app in your browser, the execution is simple:
  - Select the desired button to display the entire meal or component of your choice.
  - Click the **LET'S COOK** button to see your random selection appear on the right side of the page.
  - If you'd like to start over, click **CLEAR** to reset the page.

### Future Additions
In the future, I would like to add the following:
  - The ability to save your favorite recipes to revisit later.
  - The ability to add new sides, mains, and desserts directly in the app. (You can add them manually if you clone the repository to your machine, but I would like to be able to do it in the browser.)

### Learning and Growth
I'm happy with my first attempt at using CSS and specifically the flexbox, but I know that there is a lot of room for improvement.

This was also the first project I attempted without any collaboration from other cohort members, and I enjoyed the challenge of seeing what I could accomplish without this support.
